PM2.5,Particulate Matter 2.5,<b>PM2.5</b> refers to tiny particles in the air that are smaller than 2.5 micrometers. These tiny particles can get deep into your lungs and cause serious health problems.,"PM2.5 is caused by combustion from vehicles, industrial processes, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning, and some natural sources like dust storms.","PM2.5 can penetrate deeply into lungs, bloodstream, causing respiratory, cardiovascular diseases, aggravates asthma, reduces lung function, increases heart attack risks, and premature death."
PM10,Particulate Matter 10,"<b>PM10</b> refers to slightly larger particles in the air that are 10 micrometers or smaller. These include dust, pollen, and mold, and can cause breathing issues if inhaled.","PM10 is caused by construction sites, landfills, agriculture, roads, and natural sources like dust storms and wildfires. It includes larger particles than PM2.5, affecting respiratory health.","PM10 can causes eye, nose, throat irritation, exacerbates bronchitis, asthma, reduces lung function, raises respiratory infection, and cardiovascular disease risks."
SO2,Sulfur Dioxide,"<b>SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)</b> is a colorless gas with a sharp, irritating smell. It is a major air pollutant mainly produced by burning fossil fuels and volcanic eruptions.","SO2 emissions primarily come from the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities, vehicle emissions, and natural sources like volcanic eruptions.","SO2 can  cause respiratory problems in humans, acid rain; impacts nature by damaging forests, aquatic ecosystems, and corroding buildings and monuments."
O3,Ozone,<b>Ground-level Ozone</b> forms when pollutants from cars and industries react in sunlight. This type of ozone can cause health problems and comes from vehicle emissions and industrial activities.,Ground-level ozone is caused by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight. Emissions from vehicles and industries are major contributors.,"Ground-level Ozone irritates human respiratory systems, reduces lung function; harms nature by damaging foliage, reducing crop yields, and affecting ecosystem health."
CO,Carbon Monoxide,"<b>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</b> is a colorless, odorless gas that is produced when fuel doesn't burn completely. It can be very dangerous because it reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry.","CO is caused by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, industrial processes, residential heaters, and forest fires. Poor ventilation exacerbates exposure risks in enclosed spaces.","CO binds with hemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery, causes headaches, dizziness, weakness, confusion, in high levels can be fatal, chronic exposure harms cardiovascular, neurological health."
NO2,Nitrogen Dioxide,"<b>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)</b> is a reddish-brown gas with a sharp smell. It contributes to air pollution and is involved in the formation of smog and acid rain, affecting respiratory health.","NO2 is primarily produced from the burning of fuels in vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. It forms from reactions involving nitrogen oxides released during combustion processes.","NO2 worsens respiratory conditions in humans, contributes to ozone formation; affects nature by contributing to acid rain, damaging vegetation, and reducing biodiversity."
